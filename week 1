WEEK1:
1.	Downloading and Installing Python and Modules
a) Python 3 on Linux 
Follow the instructions given in the URL https://docs.python
guide.org/starting/install3/linux/
Beginning Python installation
For almost every Linux system, the following command could be used to install Python directly: 
$ sudo apt-get install python3.8
Getting Started
We will start our installation by writing the password as mentioned in the below picture that gives the permission to perform further operations.
 
      Assigning DiskSpace 
      Generally, it asks for additional diskspace and we generally continue  by typing Y and then enter.
 
Fetching and Installing Packages
It’s a process in which required packages and modules are fetched and installed automatically. 
It happens on it’s own when we give the permission to assign the diskspace.
 





Getting through the installation process
 

Finished Installation 
Here, the required installation is completed.
 
To verify the installation enter the following commands in your Terminal. 
python3.8

Run our First Python Program
Let’s consider a simple Hello World Program
# Python program to print 
# Hello World 
print("Hello World")

OUTPUT:
 

b)Python 3 on Windows
Follow the instructions given in the URL 
https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html(Please remember that Windows 
installation of Python is harder!) 
The installation requires downloading the official Python .exe installer and running it on your 
system. The sections below will explain several options and details during the installation 
process. 
Step 1: Select Python Version 
Deciding on a version depends on what you want to do in Python. The two major versions are 
Python 2 and Python 3. Choosing one over the other might be better depending on your project 
details. If there are no constraints, choose whichever one you prefer. 
We recommend Python 3, as Python 2 reached its end of life in 2020. Download Python 2 only 
if you work with legacy scripts and older projects. Also, choose a stable release over the newest 
since the newest release may have bugs and issues. 
Step 2: Download Python Executable Installer 
Start by downloading the Python executable installer for Windows: 
1. Open a web browser and navigate to the Downloads for Windows section of the official 
Python website. 
2.	Locate the desired Python version.
 

3. Click the link to download the file. Choose either the Windows 32-bit or 64-bit installer. 
The download is approximately 25MB.


Step 3: Run Executable Installer 

The steps below guide you through the installation process:
1.	Run the downloaded Python Installer

2.	The installation window shows two checkboxes:


Admin privileges. The parameter controls whether to install Python for the current or all 
system users. This option allows you to change the installation folder for Python. 
Add Python to PATH. The second option places the executable in the PATH variable 
after installation. You can also add Python to the PATH environment variable manually 
later.


 
For the most straightforward installation, we recommend ticking both checkboxes. 
3. Select the Install Now option for the recommended installation (in that case, skip the next two 
steps). 
To adjust the default installation options, choose Customize installation instead and proceed to 
the following step.
 
The default installation installs Python 
to C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python[version] for the current user. It 
includes IDLE (the default Python editor), the PIP package manager, and additional 
documentation. The installer also creates necessary shortcuts and file associations.
Customizing the installation allows changing these installation options and parameters. 
4. Choose the optional installation features. Python works without these features, but adding 
them improves the program's usability
 
Click Next to proceed to the Advanced Options screen. 
5. The second part of customizing the installation includes advanced options. 
Choose whether to install Python for all users. The option changes the install location 
to C:\Program Files\Python[version]. If selecting the location manually, a common choice 
is C:\Python[version] because it avoids spaces in the path, and all users can access it. Due to 
administrative rights, both paths may cause issues during package installation. 
Other advanced options include creating shortcuts, file associations, and adding Python to 
PATH.
 
After picking the appropriate options, click Install to start the installation.
6. Select whether to disable the path length limit. Choosing this option will allow Python to 
bypass the 260-character MAX_PATH limit.
 
The option will not affect any other system settings, and disabling it resolves potential name
length issues. We recommend selecting the option and closing the setup. 
Step 4: Add Python to Path (Optional) 
If the Python installer does not include the Add Python to PATH checkbox or you have not 
selected that option, continue in this step. Otherwise, skip to the next step. 
Adding the Python path to the PATH variable alleviates the need to use the full path to access the 
Python program in the command line. It instructs Windows to review all the folders added to the 
PATH environment variable and to look for the python.exe program in those folders. 
To add Python to PATH, do the following: 
1. In the Start menu, search for Environment Variables and press Enter.
 
2. Click Environment Variables to open the overview screen.
 
3.	Double-click Path on the list to edit it.
 
Alternatively, select the variable and click the Edit button.
4. Double-click the first empty field and paste the Python installation folder path.
 
Alternatively, click the New button instead and paste the path. 
3. Click OK to save the changes. If the command prompt is open, restart it for the 
following step.
c)pip3 on Windows and Linux
Install the Python package installer by following the instructions given in the 
URLhttps://www.activestate.com/resources/quick-reads/how-to-install-and
use-pip3/

Check if pip is already installed by running the following on the command line:
Pip  - -version

Or 

Pip  -v
If pip is installed, you’ll see something similar to the following output:
 
You should see something like the following if Python is installed:
 
If you do not have a version of Python installed, you can quickly download and install a recent 
version of ActivePython. 
Adding PIP to Windows Environment Variables 
One of the most common problems with running Python tools like pip is the “not on PATH” 
error. This means that Python cannot find the tool you’re trying to run in your current directory. 
In most cases, you’ll need to navigate to the directory in which the tool is installed before you 
can run the command to launch it. 
If you’d rather run pip (or other tools) from any location, you’ll need to add the directory in 
which it’s installed as a PATH environment variable by doing the following: 
1. Open up the Control Panel and navigate to System and Security > System 
2. Click on the Advanced system settings link on the left panel
3. Click Environment Variables. 
4. Under System Variables, double-click the variable PATH. 
5. Click New, and add the directory where pip is installed, e.g. C:Python33Scripts, and 
select OK.

 
Upgrading Pip on Windows 
Pip is a key tool in the Python ecosystem, and as such is updated on a regular basis. Changes can 
always be found in the release notes for each version. In order to keep your version of pip up to 
date, you can run the following on the command line:

python3 -m pip uninstall pip

This command will uninstall the outdated version of pip first, and then download the most 
current iteration. 
It’s also possible to downgrade to a previous version of pip, in case a newer version is causing 
unexpected compatibility errors. For example, to downgrade to pip v18.0 run the following 
command:

sudo apt install python3-pip    

d)Installing numpy and scipy

You can install any python3 package using the command pip3 install <packagename> 
Steps for Installing NumPy 
1. Download and Install Python. 
Python should be installed before installing NumPy. 
Download Python from Python's official website according to the operating system. After 
installing Python, Numpy is installed using different commands in different operating 
systems. 
Let's see how NumPy is installed on different operating systems. 
Installing Numpy 
1. Installing NumPy on Mac Operating System 
     1. Check if pip3 and python3 are installed correctly by running the following command:
                  Pythom3 –version
                  Pip3 –version
      2. Install numpy by using the pip command:
                     Pip3 install numpy
      3. Verify installation by typing the following command:
                    Import mumpy

2. Installing NumPy on Windows Operating System
Steps for installing NumPy on Windows: 
1. Install NumPy using the following PIP command in the command prompt terminal:
                   Pip install numpy

e)Installing jupyterlab 
Install from pip using the command pip install jupyterlab
JupyterLab 
Install JupyterLab with pip:
     Pip install jupiterlab
Note: If you install JupyterLab with conda or mamba, we recommend using the conda-forge 
channel.

Once installed, launch JupyterLab with:

Jupiterlab
